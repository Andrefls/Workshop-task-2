task-2


- The idea I had when I started this workshop-task-2, was able to count or calculate the time of the bouncing balls explosion. By doing this, I will be able to re start the cycle.
- Fisrt I watched our lecture video at https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967
- I got very useful notes from the video.
- I created my github account and also started working on it
- I also downloaded and installed the VSCODIUM program and I had a little bit of a play there. However, I am still using https://p5js.org for my coding.
- I started following the examples of the lecture, however, counter idea did not work for me.
- Then I tried to use intervals but it also did not work for me.
- Tired of trying with the examples I went to the the https://p5js.org/reference/ and start looking for some ideas to time my explosion.
- After a long reading I could not find anything that work for me. So, I tought, it must be something but I may not know how to ask
- So I went to Mr google. www.google.com and I ask if p5js has a reference to time intervals.
- After few tries, I found a link to p5js reference millis ()
- https://p5js.org/reference/p5/millis/
- millis () was something I was looking for, however, the challenge begging when I did not understand how to use it.
- first I tried to follow the instructions, after long try and for couple hours did not work.
- I keep having this error
- SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'explosionTime'. Expected ')' to end an 'if' condition and I just did not understand.
- After reading couple of time more about millis, I realised that the function was getting the total of the frames or time after the explosion, so then, I start using mathematical functions, + / - and well minus was the one. It make sense, because what I wanted was that the after the explosion the cycle re start.
- So I gave some values, so it will substract that value from millis and it work. :). However, I still have a lot question as if I changed the value to more than 460 like for example as Leo said in the workshop video 2 - 5000 mine wouldnt work. I just did not understand why?
- After solving the problem of re starting the cycle and after watching my video. I found it a bit boring to wait for the cycle re start.
- So I decided to add some functions. So, I went back to the video workshop 2 https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967 and I saw some functions with the mouse.
- I said, lets make it interactive. Why? well, all my life I ll be keen of becoming an artist, so my ideas float around that dream.
- if I can make people pause my animation, they will have a different image any time they pause it.
- I went to https://p5js.org/reference/ and type Loop, because it was a loop what I wanted to be paused.
- I found https://p5js.org/reference/p5/loop/
- Then put the function together as follow
- Mouseclick will stop the animation
- two clicks will re start the cycle.

  
- After doing this, I chatted with lecture Leo using Discord.
- I asked him about some troubles I had about loading my files, safari troubleshooting and also I asked him, if it was possible to write a note (instructions to follow) on the canvas.
- He said yes. He recommended few options and then He also share a example I could use.
- I am adding his example on my codes, I will tweek it a bit to work with my code.
- I hope people enjoy my whole week work. 

Thanks
